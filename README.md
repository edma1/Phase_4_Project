This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of cancerous blood cell detection using both traditional machine learning (with HOG features) and deep learning approaches (CNN). 
The project leverages a dataset of 5,000 blood cell smear images to compare feature engineering techniques with end-to-end deep learning.

There is also a slides deck that gathers the findings from the technical notebook and packages it into a more digestable manner.
